name: Backend API
description: Build and modify RESTful API endpoints following REST principles, consistent naming conventions, proper HTTP methods, and status codes. Use this skill when creating or editing API route files (route.ts, route.js), working on /api/ directory files, implementing CRUD operations, adding query parameters for filtering/sorting/pagination, setting up API versioning, or handling HTTP responses. Apply when working with files like app/api/*/route.ts, pages/api/*.ts, controllers, or any endpoint handlers.

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new API endpoints in `/api/` directories
- When editing existing route handlers (route.ts, route.js)
- When implementing RESTful CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- When adding filtering, sorting, or pagination to endpoints
- When determining appropriate HTTP status codes for responses
- When naming API routes and resources
- When implementing API versioning strategies
- When adding rate limiting headers to responses
