name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write strategic, minimal tests focusing on core user flows and behavior rather than implementation details. Use this skill when adding tests for completed features, writing unit or integration tests, mocking external dependencies, or deciding what to test. Apply when creating test files (.test.ts, .spec.ts), implementing Jest or Vitest tests, or determining test coverage priorities for critical paths.

## When to use this skill:

- When adding tests after completing a feature
- When writing unit tests for core functionality
- When creating integration tests for user flows
- When mocking databases, APIs, or external services
- When naming test cases descriptively
- When deciding what deserves test coverage
- When focusing on behavior over implementation
- When keeping tests fast and isolated
- When deferring edge case testing appropriately
- When working with .test.ts, .spec.ts files
- When using Jest, Vitest, or similar frameworks
