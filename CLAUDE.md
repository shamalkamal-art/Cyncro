## What is Cyncro?

Cyncro is evolving into a **Personal Proof & Money OS** that automatically captures receipts, tracks return/warranty/subscription deadlines, and turns problems into ready-to-send action packs. Users connect their Gmail, and the app automatically detects order confirmation emails, extracts purchase details using AI, and tracks everything.

**Live site:** https://cyncro.vercel.app

### Known Issues / TODO:
- Email forwarding via Resend is less reliable than Gmail API (forwarded emails lose original sender info)
- **Gmail OAuth blocked** - App is in Google "Testing" mode. Needs OAuth consent screen verification to go live (requires privacy policy, verification process). Code is ready in `lib/gmail.ts`.
- Gmail sync is manual (user clicks "Sync Now") - could add push notifications for real-time
- **Run SQL migrations** - Run migrations in Supabase dashboard:
  - `/supabase/migrations/001_subscriptions.sql` for subscriptions tables
  - `/supabase/migrations/002_cases.sql` for cases tables
  - `/supabase/migrations/003_vault.sql` for vault tables

### Premium Upgrade Plan (COMPLETE):

## Important Quirks

### AI Extraction
- The AI sometimes extracts "gmail" as merchant from forwarded emails
- Solution: We strip forwarding headers and extract merchant hint from subject line
- Always use Claude's tool calling for structured output

### Gmail vs Email Forwarding
- **Gmail API** (preferred): Reads original emails directly, more reliable
- **Email Forwarding** (backup): Forwarded emails have messy headers, sender becomes the user not the store

### Norwegian Market Focus
- App supports Norwegian stores (Elkjøp, Komplett, etc.)
- "Angrerett" = 14-day return right by law
- Currency: NOK, prices like "kr 1.234,56"

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server
npm run build    # Production build
npx vercel       # Deploy to Vercel
```

## Next Steps for User

1. **Connect Gmail** at /settings to enable automatic order detection
2. **Test sync** by clicking "Sync Now" after connecting
3. **Check purchases** at /purchases to see extracted orders
